        <h2 class="Intro">Intro</h2>
        <p class="Intro">Greetings, I am John Miccoh Reyes, a fourteen-year-old who is passionate about a wide range of pursuits. Despite my youth, my passion has no boundaries. I dabble in programming, love a variety of sports, and find comfort in writing and blogging. I get to study the fascinating world of technology and its applications in our <B><I>ICT</I></B> (Information and Communication Technology) class, which is one of my favorite subjects. Since technology and computers now rule the globe, one of my career goals is to become a <b><i>COMPUTER SCIENTIST</i></b>. Come along on this adventure with me as I explore my varied interests and keep learning and growing.</p>

        <h2 class="Best Ouput">Best Output</h2>
        <p class="Best Ouput">My finest work, in my opinion, is the interactive group presentations. Working on projects as a group has its advantages. Although there is comfort in knowing that everything will work out, there is still a chance that something won't be done correctly.

            Since I am likewise interested in our solar system and enjoy creating things with computers, I enjoyed that product. In that point, we came into a few issues like fonts not loading and size difficulties while transferring to the phone. However, everything worked out in the end, and we received an excellent grade.
            </p>

        <h1 id="section-reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Main Reflection</h2>
        <p class="Reflection1">The two most important lessons I can still vividly recall are interactive presentations and authoring tools. Since I love technology so much, it would be unbelievable if I couldn't use one for a day. authoring tools due to other factors, such as video editing. In the future, I would also like to work in the film industry, but my chances of success are low because so many people no longer like watching movies. Because creating an interactive presentation is same to creating a program. Since there are multimedia components and hyperlinks, the easiest approach to replicate programming is through interactive presenting.</p>
        <h2>Thoughts on sir Jeric</h2>
        <p class="Reflection2">He is a guy of the computer, Sir Jeric. Never in my life have I saw someone create a whole program on a white board. When I was in seventh grade, I believed Sir "Oppa" to be a mean and frightening instructor. Every time we enter the computer lab, he reminds us to tidy up the PCs we used. However, upon arriving, I observed a distinct type of educator. He's a fun, interesting teacher. He has a wonderful aura that constantly inspires us to study more.</p>
        <h2 class="Reflection3">Difficulties and Thoughts</h2>
        <p class="Reflection3"> In my journey through ICT, I've encountered numerous challenges like slow internet connections and less-than-ideal devices. These hurdles could have been discouraging, but my dedication to the subject and my genuine love for it have kept me going. Ever since I was in Grade 7, ICT has held a special place in my heart, and my interest in computers has only grown over the years. These challenges, rather than deterring me, have become a testament to my determination and resilience. They've reinforced my belief that when you're truly passionate about something, you can overcome obstacles, no matter how daunting they may seem. It's this passion that continues to drive me forward in my exploration of the exciting world of information and communication technology.</p>
